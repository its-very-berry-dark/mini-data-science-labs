This is also a tic-tac-toe game with a restriction. I was actually inspired to create it when I was watching YouTube shorts. Basically what it does is that it has the same routine of the normal tic-tac-toe game. BUT, before the player A places their symbol (let's say X), the opponent (player B) chooses either a row or a column that player A is restricted to place their symbol into. After that, it's player B's turn and it repeats. The game concludes when there are three consecutive symbols on either row, column, or diagonally. 

Goals:  
- Creating a selection for number of grids (like 3x3, 4x4)
- Incorporating both the normal and row call game for more dynamics in UI using Streamlit.
