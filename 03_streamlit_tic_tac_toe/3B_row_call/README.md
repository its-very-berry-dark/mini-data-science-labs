This is also a tic-tac-toe game with a restriction. I was actually inspired to create it when I was watching YouTube shorts. Basically what it does is that it has the same routine of the normal tic-tac-toe game. BUT, before the player A places their symbol (let's say X), the opponent (player B) chooses either a row or a column that player A is restricted to place their symbol into. After that, it's player B's turn and it repeats. The game concludes when there are three consecutive symbols on either row, column, or diagonally.
