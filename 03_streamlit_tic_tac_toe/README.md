This mini project employs the use of Python to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game and integrate it into a Streamlit webapp. My objective for this is to make myself more familiar with the usage of Streamlit. This has two types of games: a normal tic-tac-toe, and a row call tic-tac-toe. In the future, I will incorporate a selection of grid numbers for players to 
use.

*Note: As of now, I'm not moving the normal game into its folder yet, as I'd need to fix the streamlit link again (10/24/2025)*
