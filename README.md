**03 | Tic-Tac-Toe via Streamlit**
This mini project employs the use of Python to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game and integrate it into a Streamlit webapp. My objective for this is to make myself more familiar with the usage of Streamlit and also, I'm more familiar with the mentioned library than other display UIs for now.
